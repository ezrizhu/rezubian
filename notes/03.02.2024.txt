A: lilys very high
B: lily figured out what a card is in a game
A card is a list of inputs and outputs
input: some combination of state changes to the system
output: some combinations of states changes to the system

player wants to play a card
what combination of state changes are involved?

Input:
cost: player needs to pay for card
cost: card in hand
cost: other cards may be used aswell

Output:
card may be moved
effects applied

Integers:

card has conditions, if condition made, it will have side effects

starting: nothing in decks

game bootstrapping: only side effects, no conditions has to be made

each card will track the last place it moved to

every card in the game can be stored in one list, and each card individually can store the last card it moved to

AI: what combination of cards player having access to -> $$$

card existance -> money gained

amount of players playing & time playing!!

way to transcribe any card game using basic instructions
universal system to describe whats happening in a card game

a card can be used in multiple types of games, because they can have different values.
e.g., one can play magic at the same time as uno, effect crossovers

name - unique identifier

all cards have statically defined starting points, so do all board game zones
players have statically defined access to starting point/zone

car
named_car = 1;
named-cat = 0;
named_apple = 0;

initially, players can input how they want the game to feel/look, then cards will be generated for that.

creators can build their own games with our generator, and we can profit. naturally no competition

1. prove that every card game is be able to described as a simple set of parameters/maths
2. crowdsource the efforts
